      <h4> About Me </h4>
        <p>
        Hi! My name is Cece Brannan. I am a sixteen year-old girl in St. Louis. I started 3D Printing with my dad, and I hope to bring 3D 
        printing to families of St. Louis. 3D printing is the future, and it is important for people of all ages to be introduced to this 
        new and innovative form of technology.
        </p>
      <h4> What I Do </h4>
        <p>
        We make 3D printers out of our house, ordering some parts online, and 3D printing the rest. 3D printers require work, but are worth the 
        time put in. It is important to understand the general mechanics of printers, which I can explain with a manual and installation. 
        These machines will have problems, but I can come, fix these, and teach you how to fix them in case it happens again. By using a 
        3D printer, one learns about technology of the future
